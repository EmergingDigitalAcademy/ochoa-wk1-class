# Tier 1 Week 1 Intro | [Video](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/1027491516/609b2876b3)

How to Get the Most Out of Tier 1

Put in the Time

EDA requires 15+ hours EVERY SINGLE WEEK in Tier 1.

* If you aren't spending that amount of time it is going to show up in your work.
* This time should be a couple of hours every day. It helps you learn and allows for things to go wrong.

What To Do

These are the things we expect you to be doing in Tier 1:

1. Attend all classes. Ask Questions.
2. Complete ALL assignments.
3. Submit assignments on time.
4. Communicate. Tell us what is in your way or if you will be late/absent.
5. Ask for help. We're on the same team. You don't get a GPA. Cheating only hurts you.

If we notice you are not doing the above, you can expect that we will reach out and want to talk about it.

Assignments

Every week you will have a graded assignment. These assignments are in addition to any videos or class content.
Plan on spending 6+ hours every week actively working through these assignments. You CAN ask others and compare solutions. Strive to understand, not just complete the work.


Grades

| Unit | Topic |
| ---------- | --------- |
	
| Missing/Incomplete | Not submitted! Or insufficient work done |
| Reinforcement Needed | Base requirements not met |
| Meets Expectations | You got it! This is a great place to be |
| Exceeds Expectations | Holy cats! Above and beyond |


Meets Expectations

Scoring "Reinforcement Needed" on all your work is not a good trend. These scores are meaningful and represent your progress at the time.
We expect you to score Meets Expectations on 50% of these Graded Assignments. NOTE that as you resubmit work, we won't re-grade or adjust it.

Late or Missing Assignments

We move fast! We also can't tell how you are doing without seeing your work. So missing or late assignments is a HUGE DEAL!

Consequences

* If your assignment is more than 3 days late we will talk with you about what is going on.
* If you are missing multiple assignments or Units of work we may halt your progress.

Again, we need to see your work in order to help you learn at the pace we require.

Resubmitting Assignments

Tier 1 is in place to become skilled with the fundamental programming concepts and syntax required to move on.
If your assignment is scored "Reinforcement Needed" it will be marked "Resubmission Required" in the Portal.

1. Take our feedback and complete the assignment to Base requirements

    * Be sure to ask questions to each other and Instructors!

1. Your Resubmission will have a Due Date. It is your responsibility to get that done on time!


We Want You To Succeed

In the end, EDA is an intense experience, and we want you to succeed.
What we need from you is a willingness to:

1. Take Chances, Make Mistakes - More learning happens when you make mistakes. We ask that you try everything we throw at you.
2. Use your Peers - Your biggest asset is your cohort - make the connections and struggle together. You will be stronger together.

    * Slack and Google Meets are you tools to work with others. Use them

1. Ask for help from your instructors - We can't read your mind. You have to be proactive and advocate for your own education.

    * Slack your Instructor regarding attendance or academic concerns.

1. Use EDA Staff for help - Everyone at EDA desires to help you - all staff and all of the instructors. Talk to us!

    * Slack your Instructor and Cohort Advisor for support.
